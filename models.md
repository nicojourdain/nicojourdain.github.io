Here are the models that I have been using:

* [NEMO][1] (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean), including the OPA ocean model, the SI<sup>3</sup> sea ice model, as well as ice-shelf and iceberg modules.

* [Elmer/Ice][2], an open-source finite-element software for modelling the ice sheet and glacier dynamics.

* [MAR][3], a regional atmospheric model including a fine representation of polar processes.

* [WRF][4], a regional atmospheric model with numerous available physical parameterizations.

Some of these models have been coupled:

* NEMO-Elmer/Ice, see [Favier et al. (2019)][8].

* TANGO (NEMO-OASIS-MAR), developed by [Jourdain et al. (2011)][7], updated by [Huot et al. (2022)][11].

* NOW (NEMO-OASIS-WRF), developed by [Samson et al. (2014)][6], used in Li et al. ([2017][9],[2020][10]).
