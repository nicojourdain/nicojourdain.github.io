Here are the models that I'm currently using:

* [NEMO][1] (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean), including the OPA ocean model and the LIM sea ice model.

* [Elmer/Ice][2], an open-source finite-element software for ice sheets, glaciers and ice flow modelling.

* [MAR][3], a regional atmospheric model including a fine representation of polar processes.

* [WRF][4], a regional atmospheric model with numerous available physical parameterizations.

Some of these models have been coupled:

* NEMO-Elmer/Ice, see [first simulation][5].

* NOW (NEMO-OASIS-WRF), developed by [Samson et al. (2014)][6].

* TANGO (NEMO-OASIS-MAR), developed by [Jourdain et al. (2011)][7], to be updated.
