## Research Interests
I am currently studying the interactions between the cryosphere (ice-shelves, ice sheet, sea ice) and the ocean/atmosphere system, mostly focusing on the Southern Ocean and Antarctica. Previously, I've mainly worked on tropical cyclones, the Indo-Pacific climate, and ocean-atmosphere interactions. A large part of my work is based on numerical models designed to simulate some physical constituents of the climate system.
