## Contribution to ISOMIP+

We have contributed to the 2nd Ice Shelf-Ocean Model Intercomparison Project ([ISOMIP+][1]) using the [NEMO][2] ocean model. This MIP consists of five experiments that are fully described in [Asay-Davis et al. (2016)][3]. So far, nine institutes (for seven different models) have submitted  their simulations for the three first experiments (static geometry). Submission of the last two experiments is expected in April.

Below is an example of our results for ISOMIP+ EXP3, showing a warm forcing with retreating ice-shelf geometry.
