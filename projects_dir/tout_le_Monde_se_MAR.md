MAR (**Modèle Atmosphérique Régional**) is an atmosphere model designed for meteorological and climatic research. It is used for a wide range of applications, from km-scale process studies to continental-scale multi-decadal simulations. It can be run for ideal test cases (e.g., 1-dimensional studies, simple gravity-wave configuration) or for realistic applications (constrained by reanalyses, operational forecasts, or global climate models). MAR was created in the mid-1990s, and most developments since then have been undertaken at IGE (former LGGE)/CNRS/UGA, Grenoble, France, and at the Liège University, Belgium. 

The aim of "tout le Monde se MAR" is to open the code to the international community and to create a dedicated website designed to facilitate its implementation and use on various platforms and for a large range of applications. This project is funded by the OSUG@2020 labex over 2016-2018.
