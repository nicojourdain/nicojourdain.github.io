We have been granted 20,000 USD to facilitate collaborations between the Institute of Geosciences and Environment (IGE), Grenoble, France, and the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University, USA. The aim is to enhance French-US collaborations to reduce uncertainty in global sea level rise predictions.
