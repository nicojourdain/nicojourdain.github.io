We have been granted 327,316 AUSD to implement a regional coupled atmosphere/ocean model to determine under what circumstance small-scale ocean-atmosphere interactions are critical for the simulation of the Australian climate..

Decision makers assessing climate impacts and adaptation require credible projections at sufficiently fine spatial and temporal scales to be useful. Our aim is to quantify and understand how small-scale, rapidly evolving ocean and atmosphere phenomena (e.g. ocean eddies, weather systems) that are poorly resolved in coarse-resolution Global Climate Models (GCMs) and air-sea interactions absent from high-resolution Regional Climate Models (RCMs), alter the simulation of local climate, and how these factors modify future climate projections. This will be achieved using a hierarchy of experiments using the coupled regional climate model NOW (NEMO-OASIS-WRF).
