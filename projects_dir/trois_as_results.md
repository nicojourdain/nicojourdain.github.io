## March 2017 - Ocean circulation and sea-ice thinning induced by melting ice shelves
The ice-shelf cavities of the Amundsen Sea, Antarctica, act as very powerful pumps that create strong inflows of warm water under the ice-shelves, as well as significant circulation changes in the entire region. Such warm inflows bring more heat than required to melt ice, so that a large part of that heat exits ice-shelf cavities without being used. Due to mixing between warm deep waters and melt freshwater, melt-induced flows are warm and buoyant when they leave cavities. Therefore, they reach the ocean surface near ice-shelf fronts and can melt significant amounts of sea ice. It is thus suggested that climatic trends in sub ice-shelf melt could partly explain sea ice trends near the ice-sheet margins in the Amundsen Sea region.
