I am looking for two motivated and qualified postdoctoral research associates (postdocs) to join the UW Hydro | Computational Hydrology group. One is on an NSF-funded project to study hydrological and stream temperature changes under climate change, while the other is on a NASA-funded project to develop infrastructure that supports hyper-resolution, large ensemble, continental-scale hydrologic modeling. You can find details about the position on our join page.
