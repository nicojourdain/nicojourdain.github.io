title: "A climatology of Antarctic iceberg melt"

Nacho Merino's paper on iceberg melt over the Southern Ocean has just been
accepted for publication in Ocean Modelling. **Here is the
[link](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2016.05.001)**.


In this paper, Nacho estimates the **Antarctic iceberg freshwater flux with a
sea ice/ocean/iceberg model**. The simulations have been performed with NEMO,
LIM2 and NEMO-ICB iceberg module within DRAKKAR-ORCA025 model configuration.

Nacho has modified NEMO-ICB in order to account for the vertical shear of ocean
currents, which he shows **improves significantly modeled iceberg trajectories**.
In result, the iceberg model overall reproduces the observed probability of
iceberg presence.

*The above illustration shows the probability of iceberg detection in a
100 km x 100 km grid cell during a year.
(a) Observations from ALTIBERG database (Tournadre , 2015),
(b) Model results.*

Nacho also founds that with few local deviations, **iceberg meltwater generally
increases sea ice formation around Antarctica**.
His results therefore underline the importance of improving the representation
of Antarctic freshwater sources in earth system models.

*This illustration show the estimated climatology of iceberg freshwater flux over
the Southern Ocean in mm/day for
(a) summer, (b) autumn, (c) winter and (d) spring seasons.*

Nacho further shows that this can be achieved by forcing ocean/sea ice models
with a climatological iceberg fresh-water flux. His **climatology of iceberg
freshwater flux is included in the paper's supplementary material** for use in
climate models and described further [here](http://neichin.github.io/personalweb/material/meltwater/).

This is Nacho's first paper as first author.
A great achievement. Congratulations Nacho !
