The TiPACCs project (Tipping Points in Antarctic Climate Components), funded by the European Commission (H2020) has started. The kick-off meeting took place on October 10th, and the project will run until 2023. The project is led by Svein Ã˜sterhus and Petra Langebroek (NORCE), and partners are from Norway (NORCE), UK (UNN), Germany (AWI, PIK), and France (UGA).

We will investigate the stability regime of ocean temperatures beneath Antarctic ice shelves and of the ice-sheet dynamics, as well as feedbacks between both. More details can be found on the [TiPACCs website](http://www.tipaccs.eu).
