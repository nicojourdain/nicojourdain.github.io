date: 2024-01-16

Some good news to start the new year: after several years of work to prepare the protocol and an observational "MIPkit", the MISOMIP2 protocol is now available for discussion on the EGUsphere portal. See [https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-95](https://doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-2024-95).

We encourage any potential participant to post comments, questions or suggestions about the protocol on the EGUsphere. We will reply to the feedback, and can consider any suggestions in a revised version of the manuscript. The expected closing date of the online discussion phase is 12 March.

Also, please let any new or interested colleagues know about MISOMIP2, and direct them to the mailing list.
