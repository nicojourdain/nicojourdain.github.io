title: "New paper on ice shelf melting projections in the Amundsen Sea"

The parameterisation of ocean-induced melting beneath ice shelves is a major source of uncertainty in projections of the Antarctic contribution to sea level rise (e.g., [ISMIP6 results](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3033-2020)). Melting projections based on ocean models are needed to calibrate and evaluate such parametrisations, but so far, there have been very few projections of this kind ([Naughten et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-17-0854.1); [Timmermann and Hellmer 2013](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10236-013-0642-0)).

In a [new study published in GRL](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GL100629), we present presents ocean, sea ice and ice shelf melt projections for the Amundsen Sea based on a 1/12° configuration of the [NEMO ocean model](https://www.nemo-ocean.eu). As shown in the figure below, melt rates are typically multiplied by 1.4–2.2 from present day to 2100 in a high-end scenario with no climate policy. We show that changes in local/regional atmospheric forcing and in remote ocean properties both explain these changes.

*Simulated ice shelf basal melt rates for 1989-2009 and 2080-2100 under the RCP8.5 emission scenario.*

These projections can be used to narrow the range of basal melt parameters, on which there was very little confidence in the ISMIP6 projections ([Seroussi et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3033-2020)) and their emulation ([Edwards et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03302-y)). Our results in the Amundsen Sea indicate that the most extreme melt projections used to constrain high-end sea level projections may have been significantly overestimated.
