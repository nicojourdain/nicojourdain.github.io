title: "New paper on ice shelf melting projections in the Amundsen Sea"
date: 2022-11-22

The parameterisation of ocean-induced melting beneath ice shelves is a major source of uncertainty in projections of the Antarctic contribution to sea level rise (e.g., [ISMIP6 results](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-14-3033-2020)). Melting projections based on ocean models are needed to calibrate and evaluate such parametrisations, but there are so far very few projections of this kind.

In a [new study published in GRL](https://doi.org/10.1029/2022GL100629), we present presents ocean, sea ice and ice shelf melt projections for the Amundsen Sea based on a 1/12° configuration of the [NEMO ocean model](https://www.nemo-ocean.eu). As shown in the figure below, melt rates are typically multiplied by 1.4–2.2 from present day to 2100 in a high-end scenario with no climate policy. We show that changes in local/regional atmospheric forcing and in remote ocean properties both explain these changes.
