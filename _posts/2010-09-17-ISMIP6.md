The main results from the Ice Sheet Model intercomparison Project for CMIP6 (ISMIP6 ) have been published today. They include new sea-level projections to 2100 induced by mass changes of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets. The main ISMIP6 papers related to Greenland are [Goelzer et al. (2020)][Goelzer20] and [Slater et al. (2020)][Slater20], and are not discussed here. As I've only worked on the Antarctic part, let's focus on the Southern hemisphere... 

## Historical context and previous estimates

The first three IPCC Assessment Reports (AR), written between 1990 and 2001, found that Antarctica would gain mass throughout the 21st century, which is equivalent to a negative contribution to sea level ([Shepherd and Nowicki 2017][Shepherd17]). The evolution of the ice sheet dynamics was indeed thought to be unlikely over such relatively short time scales, and increasing snow accumulation was thought to be the main driver of future Antarctic mass gain. The AR4, in 2007, was the 1st IPCC report to report a possible sea-level contribution of the Antarctic ice-sheet dynamics, as satellite observations had started to show mass loss in West Antarctica.

In SeaRISE ([Bindschadler et al. 2013][Bindschadler13]), the ice-sheet model intercomparison project organized just before IPCC's 5th Assessment Report, a uniform basal melting anomaly was prescribed (increasing linearly from 0 to 30m/yr through the 21st century) to represented the expected behaviour of CMIP5 ocean models under RCP8.5. At the time, several models were also not able to capture grounding line motions ([Durand and Pattyn, 2015][Durand15]), and the predicted Antarctic contribution to sea level ranged between 0 and +14 cm of SLE over the 21st century ([Bindschadler et al. 2013][Bindschadler13]). By deriving the dynamic ice-sheet response from linear response functions for basal ice-shelf melting for four different Antarctic drainage regions (based on SeaRISE results), [Levermann et al. (2014)][Levermann14] found a _likely_ contribution between +4 and +21 cm of SLE over the 21st century.

Last year, the IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate ([SROCC, 2019][SROCC19]) estimated that under RCP8.5, Antarctica would _likely_ contribute between 3 and 28 cm SLE. This was informed by [Levermann et al. (2014)][Levermann14] as well as other studies based on individual ice sheet models (Golledge et al. [2014][Golledge14],[2019][Golledge19]; [De Conto and Pollard 2016][DeConto16]; [Bulthuis et al. 2019][Bulthuis19]), with various strategies to represent future ice-shelf melting by the ocean.

[Seroussi et al. (2020)][Seroussi20] present the results from 18 ice sheet simulations produced by 15 international groups. The contribution of the Antarctic ice sheet in response to increased warming during this period varies between -7.8 and 30.0 cm of Sea Level Equivalent (SLE). The novelty in these projections is the close link to projections from several [carefully selected][Barthel20] CMIP5 models (results forced by CMIP6 projections will be published later on), which explains the involvement of physical oceanographers and atmosphere scientists in ISMIP6. 

 
## Huge uncertainty on future melting by the ocean


## Uncertainty from other poorly represented processes


## Beyond 2100?

ABUMIP

atmospheric forcing?


## Comparison to present-day trends


## Effects

Not uniform over the golbal oceans ([Hamlington et al. 2020][Hamlington20])

Thermal expansion + glaciers + IS + storage => a total of 1m in 2100 cannot be excluded.

According to the recent estimates of [Kulp and Strauss (2019)][Kulp19], 230 million people currently occupy land that is less than 1m above sea level.

Objective of the PROTECT project.
