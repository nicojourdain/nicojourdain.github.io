Within ice shelf cavities, tides primarily affect ice/ocean interactions by increasing velocities and therefore turbulent exchanges along the ice base. This effect is relatively more important for large and cold cavities, such as Ross and Filchner-Ronne, where tidal currents can be significantly stronger than buoyancy-driven currents \citep[e.g.][]{macayeal84,padman03,makinson11}, in contrast to other Antarctic ice shelves \citep[e.g., ][]{hemer06,robertson13}. Finally, the extra melting caused by tides induces an additional buoyancy-driven residual circulation, which in turn increases ice-shelf melting \citep{macayeal84b,makinson99}. Estimating the relative importance of each of these tidal processes is a prerequisite for better prescribing or parameterizing the effect of tides on ice shelf cavities.
