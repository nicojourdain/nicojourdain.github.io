I am looking for two motivated and qualified PhD Students to join the **[MEOM group](http://lgge.osug.fr/meom/)** at LGGE. The two PhD projects are related to the future **[SWOT altimetric mission](https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/)**.

One is on a CNES-funded project to **study how to retrieve information  on ocean currents from SWOT ocean data**, while the other is on a UGA-funded project to **study the sources and footprints of submesoscale variability in the North Atlantic**. 

Both projects will start in September 2016. Please,  contact me for further details about the positions.
