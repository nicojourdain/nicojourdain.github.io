I gave lectures at the Southern Ocean Summer School organised by JB Sallée at the Institut d’Etudes Scientifiques de Cargèse, Corsica, from 7th to 18th May 2024. The summer school was funded by the H2020 project SO-CHIC, the Horizon Europe project OCEAN:ICE, and the European Geophysical Union.

Here are my two 1-hour lectures:
