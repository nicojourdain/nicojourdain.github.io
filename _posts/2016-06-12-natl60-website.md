100 Tb of model data ! This is roughly what will come out of the new NATL60 simulation Jean Marc is working on at the moment. 
NATL60 is our new North Atlantic configuration of NEMO ocean model that runs at an unprecedented 1/60° horizontal resolution 
with 300 vertical levels. This model configuration is used for preparing SWOT altimeter mission and for studying what are the 
mechanisms that energize ocean submesoscales at mid to high latitude.

Jean-Marc is working literally nights and days for this second model simulation. The first simulation was run on Occigen 
supercomputer at CINES, this second one is run on Curie supercomputer at TGCC. This new model simulation is designed so 
that we can perform a rigorous evaluation of resolved ocean fine scales as compared to OSMOSIS measurment array. 

Meanwhile Aurélie has started disseminating output of the first simulation to collaborators in the SWOT Science Team.
Several groups (in particular at LOCEAN and LPOS) are now actively working with NATL60 model output. We are more than 
happy to share this unprecedented model experiment with interested researchers in the field. For more information, see
