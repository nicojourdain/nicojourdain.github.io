We have run the first ocean/ice-sheet simulations based on the [NEMO][2]-[Elmer/ice][4] coupled model. 

Below is an example of the advance/retreat coupled experiment proposed by [Asay-Davis et al. (2016)][3] in the context of [MISOMIP1][1]. It shows the evolution of the melt rate, ice draft, and ocean temperature, for 100 years under warm conditions, followed by 100 years under cold conditions.
