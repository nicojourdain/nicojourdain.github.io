title: "Workshop on ice shelves in NEMO"
date: 2018-04-12
---

The capability to simulate the ocean in ice shelf cavities has been recently implemented in NEMO [Mathiot et al. (2017)][1]. This has opened new oportunities for regional or global studies, with prescribed or thermodynamically interactive ice shelf melting, including coupling to ice-sheet models.

The aims of this workshop are to: 

* Keep informed on who is using NEMO's ice shelf module and for what applications.

* Share experience in the development of global or regional NEMO configurations.

* Share experience in coupling to ice sheet models (BISICLES, Elmer/Ice).

* Discuss future developments needed in NEMO regarding ice shelves.

The workshop will be held at IGE, University Grenoble-Alpes, France ([see location on map][2]), on Friday 7 September 2018. For those attending to the [FRISP meeting][3], transportation will be arranged from Aussois to Grenoble on Thursday evening. The workshop will start relatively early on Friday morning so that participants can take a train or fly home on Friday evening. The closest international airports are Lyon Saint Exupery ([1h by bus from Grenoble][4]) and Geneva ([2h15 by bus from Grenoble][5]).
