After many years of developments, Earth System Models start including interactive ice sheets, e.g. [UKESM representing Greenland & Antarctica and their interactions with the global ocean and atmosphere](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021MS002520) and [used for scenario-based projections](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-2021-371). Interactions between climate and the Antarctic ice sheet are now represented [regionally in the Belgian PARASO model](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-553-2022) and [globally in the US E3SM model](https://doi.org/10.1029/2021MS002468). Interactions with the Greenland ice sheet are also now [represented in CESM2 thanks to a Netherlands-US collaboration](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020MS002356) and [in EC-EARTH thanks to a European collaboration](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-2020-446). Similar ongoing efforts in other institutes, like IPSL (Paris) and IGE (Grenoble) as part of the [ESM2025 European project](https://www.esm2025.eu). Of course many things are yet to be improved in the aforementioned models, e.g. Greenlandic fjords and Antarctic grounding zone in coarse resolution ocean models, calving, icebergs, etc...
