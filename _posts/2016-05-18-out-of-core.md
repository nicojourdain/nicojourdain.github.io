Transforming large gridded datasets into scientific results requires
innovative descriptive approaches that merge **statistical descriptions and
physically-motivated analyses**. This usually involves performing rather
“complex” analysis tasks on gridded datasets.

Research software used for performing these analyses are facing a challenge
with the ongoing evolution of geo-scientific models and earth observing networks.
Indeed, with **the most high-end models being runs on several tens of thousand
cores**, even a two-dimensional slice of model output cannot be loaded in memory
at one time. Model diagnostic tools and **gridded data analysis tools should
therefore be parallelized** and run out-of-core.

I believe that this question is not a “technical” problem but a real challenge
for our field of research. We are here facing a “technical” translation of one
of the **big data challenges** in earth system science. We need to **embrace
this question at a community level**.

Great **tools have emerged in the python ecosystem** for tackling this question.
I am in particular thinking about [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) and
[dask](http://dask.pydata.org) python packages. In a recent [project](http://oocgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), I am
involved in  trying to leverage the potential of
[xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) and
[dask](http://dask.pydata.org)
for the analysis of gridded dataset in earth system science.

More about this project can be found on readthedocs
[here](http://oocgcm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/out-of-core.html) and
