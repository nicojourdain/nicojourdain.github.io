The Southern Ocean (oceans south of 30Â°S) plays a key role in global biogeochemical cycles. But large environmental changes are ongoing in the Southern Ocean physical and biogeochemical properties. These changes reflect widespread environmental changes that are occurring throughout the southern hemisphere and over the Southern Ocean (changes in surface winds, solar radiation, sea ice cover and glacial melt from Antarctica). How the Southern Ocean primary production and carbon cycle will respond to these changing climate stressors is a matter of concern in the climate science community.

**"SOBUMS : Southern Ocean Biogeochemistry Under Multiple Stressors"** project has just been accepted for funding by ANR for 2017-2020. SOBUMS project team involves researchers and engineers from LOCEAN, LSCE, Mercator-Ocean and LGGE. With this project, we will undertake modelling work with NEMO and PISCES in order to : 

 - Quantify how changes in each climate stressors will affect Southern Ocean primary production, CO2 uptake and carbonate chemistry (pH).
 - Quantify the integrated response of Southern Ocean biogeochemistry and carbon cycle to future changes in climate stressors.
 - Assess the ability of NEMO model configuration to be used in CMIP6 ESMs to quantitatively capture the response of Southern Ocean biogeochemistry to changing climatic stressors.
 - Quantify the uncertainties in the representation of the processes involved in the Southern Ocean biogeochemical response to changing climate stressors in NEMO model configurations.


Over the next 4 years, the project will fund : 

 - a research engineeer at LOCEAN (Paris) for 18 months.
 - a research engineer at LSCE (Saclay) for 36 months.
 - a postdoc at LGGE (Grenoble) for 24 months.
 - a postdoc at LOCEAN (Paris) for 24 months
