title: "A series of animation of the latest NATL60 model simulation."

We have started analysing our latest NATL60 simulation that Jean Marc has produced over the summertime. 
NATL60 is our NEMO-based North Atlantic model configuration that runs at an unprecedented 1/60° horizontal resolution 
with 300 vertical levels. We use NATL60 for preparing SWOT altimeter mission and for studying ocean cross-scale 
interactions at mid to high latitudes. 

The latest NATL60 simulation performed by Jean Marc comes with improved numerics 
and improved boundary conditions as compared to the first simulation performed in Dec 2014. 
We therefore expect the solution to be more reliable and less affected by grid discretization.   

The new model simulation spans the same period as the field observations collected during OSMOSIS campaign in Porcupine plain. 
We should therefore be able to assess precisely how the model reproduces the statistics of velocity gradients at fine scale.

Aurélie has prepared a [series of animations](https://mycore.core-cloud.net/public.php?service=files&t=dc67e596c0fc351ebca702ef287d5cc6) 
of surface currents, surface relative vorticity and vertical velocity at 100m. 
The computational domain is split into four quadrans so that we see more details in each panel. 
These animations show the very strong seasonnality of submesoscale dynamics in the North Atlantic. 

We are now starting more in-depth analyses with Aurélie and Adekunle, who just has started his PhD in the group. 
We will focus on performing a thorough model-data inter-comparison with the new NATL60 simulation. 
Do not hesitate to contact us for more information about NATL60 model simulations.
