A wonderful collaboration with talented early career researchers in Grenoble (_Les Plateformistes_) has led to a new publication in _Nature_.

We estimated dates, in given anthropogenic emission scenarios, beyond which individual ice shelves can no longer exist as we know them. We took into account all uncertainties related to the future of the ice, atmosphere, and ocean, including deep uncertainties about poorly understood processes such as ice fracturing and calving.

*Number of non-viable ice shelves as a function of (a) global air temperatures, (b) time in a low-emission scenario (pink in panel a), and (c) time in a high emission scenario (purple in panel a). The colors in panels b and c indicate the probability of non-viability to be reached. The calculation of this probability was done in a way to give more weight to realizations close to available observations.*

These results have been reported in _Le Monde_ by Lea Sanchez, [here in French](https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2025/10/29/une-majorite-de-plateformes-glaciaires-de-l-antarctique-menacees-a-long-terme-dans-un-scenario-pessimiste-de-poursuite-du-rechauffement-climatique_6650190_3244.html) or [here in English](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/environment/article/2025/10/30/most-antarctic-ice-shelves-face-long-term-threat-under-worst-case-global-warming-scenario_6746927_114.html)
